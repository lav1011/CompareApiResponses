Prerequisites:-
1) Install Java
2) Install Gradle


Here is my build.gradle dependency

plugins {
    id 'java'
}

group 'CompareApiResponses '
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'

sourceCompatibility = 1.8

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile group: 'org.testng', name: 'testng', version: '6.10'
    compile group: 'io.rest-assured', name: 'rest-assured', version: '3.0.7'
}



 Instructions :-
1) I have included all the dependency im build.gradle.
2) I have pasted all the endpoints file in CompareApiResponses/src/test/resources folder. If you want to add any open endpoint you can add.
3) There are total 2 Files i have used in this framework.
   a)  Under ApiServices/CommonUtils package In ApiUtils i have written the business logic.
   b)  Main test cases you can run from FileComprison.java file.
   c)  I have written two functions one for reading the file(fileReader) and the other to hit the API endpoint and compare the json response result(compareJsonResponse)\

4) I can try to cover other scenarios but logic needs to be changes. I am extracting Json first Object and comparing with the other Objects. This Test Will run for open source API's like
   https://reqres.in/api/users/5  and https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1.

  If you want to give or test the other API's You need to change
  the logic to extract the required json object in line 54,55 in ApiUtils.java (Pass the required string).


5) Last but not the least i am still a learner. Please pass on the valuable feedback so that i can improve and adapt the given suggestions.



Thank You.
